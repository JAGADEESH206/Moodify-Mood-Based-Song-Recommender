#### Project summary:
This is a GUI-based mood-based song recommender. The user selects a mood (Happy, Sad, Relaxed, Energetic), and the app suggests a list of songs based on that mood using the iTunes API. It filters repetitive or irrelevant tracks and presents 5 fresh recommendations in a chat-style interface. Great for combining music, user experience, and APIs in one project.
